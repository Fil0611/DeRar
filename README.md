# DeRar
DeRar is a simple Java program to brute force the keyword of a RAR file.


# How to run
I personally suggest compiling and running the program from the Windows command prompt.

To run the program you must write this commands on the Windows command prompt:
- javac -encoding UTF-8 derar.java -> to compile the program
- java derar -> to run the program

Some threads may work faster than others.


# Extraction
If the windows showing the progress of the keyword check close without it reaching 100% it means the archive got extracted in the folder.
